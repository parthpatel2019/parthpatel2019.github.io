## [My Interest - Machine Learning](https://p7patel.wixsite.com/parthpatel/links)

I have a strong interest for machine learning. I have been constatnly developing my skills in it. No matter what machine learning project I am working on, some of my favorite commands are:
```
model.train(x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test)
model.accuracy()
```

I love these two commands because it shows me how my model is training and how well it is learning and able to predict the output. The whole aspect of machine learning!
